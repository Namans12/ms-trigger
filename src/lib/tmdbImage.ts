/**
 * Right-sizing for TMDB images.
 *
 * Poster URLs reach the browser with a size already baked in, and it is almost
 * never the size we render at: releasebot.py:374 stores full `/t/p/w500/...`
 * URLs in Postgres, and lib/tmdbProxy.ts hands out w500 for live search/browse
 * results. Meanwhile the same URL gets rendered at 36px in the calendar, 48px
 * on a compact row, and ~150px in a grid. A w500 poster is ~70KB; the w92 the
 * calendar actually needs is ~6.7KB.
 *
 * Rather than migrate stored data (which would still leave one size serving
 * every consumer), this rewrites the size segment at render time. Each call
 * site asks for the width it actually displays. The regex trick is the same one
 * src/types/digest.ts:49 already uses to recover a bare path from a stored URL.
