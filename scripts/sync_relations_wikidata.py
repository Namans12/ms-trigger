"""Must Watch generator, source B: Wikidata narrative sequence.

Free SPARQL endpoint, no key, no auth. Resolves a TMDB id to a Wikidata entity
via P4947 (TMDB movie ID) / P4983 (TMDB TV series ID), then reads:

    P155  follows            -> must, direction='before'
    P156  followed by        -> must, direction='after'
    P179  part of the series -> context only, never an edge of its own

P179 identifies the series so P155/P156 can be sanity-checked against it. An
edge pointing outside the series is suspicious and is written at confidence
0.60 — below MUST_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR, so it lands in the table for inspection
without ever rendering.

Every related entity must round-trip back to a TMDB id via P4947/P4983.
Anything that doesn't is dropped; there is deliberately no title-search
fallback here, because Wikidata labels and TMDB titles disagree often enough
to produce confidently wrong matches.

=============================================================================
SPOT CHECK RESULT, 2026-08-16: THIS GENERATOR IS NOT SHIPPED. DO NOT RUN THE
SYNC WITHOUT REDOING THE CHECK AND READING THIS FIRST.
=============================================================================

`--spot-check` over 19 resolved titles returned 18 edges across 10 of them.
Three were wrong:

    Empire Strikes Back  -> before: The Star Wars Holiday Special
    Mad Max: Fury Road   -> before: Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
    Mad Max: Fury Road   -> after:  Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga

The first two are brand sequence sold as narrative necessity. The third is
worse: Furiosa is a *prequel*, so encoding release order inverts the direction
outright — exactly the divergence this check exists to find. ~17% wrong, on a
feature where one bad "you must watch this first" costs more trust than ten
missing edges buy.

Three further findings, each independently disqualifying:

  1. The P179 sanity check does not work. Once duplicate rows are collapsed
     (see `collapse`), zero edges in the sample crossed a series boundary —
     including all three wrong ones. It cannot separate good from bad, so the
     0.60 confidence tier it was meant to feed never triggers.

  2. Coverage is thin and lands where it is least needed. Seven sample titles
     produced nothing at all, including every MCU entry — the shared universe
     the design doc singles out as the case users care most about. What it does
     return (Godfather, LOTR, Toy Story, John Wick, Star Wars) is almost
     entirely already covered by TMDB collections in Phase 1.

  3. Precedence makes its mistakes permanent. 'wikidata' outranks 'seed', so
     once a wrong edge is written the offline seed — the component the design
     doc names as the fallback carrier for cross-franchise continuity — can
     never correct it. Verified against the real upsert predicate. Writing at
     0.70 does not help: the row still exists and still blocks the seed, it
     just also never renders.

Per the design doc's own escape hatch ("If Phase 2's spot-check fails, skip it
entirely and go to Phase 3 ... Nothing downstream depends on Wikidata
shipping"), Phase 2 is skipped. The script is kept because `--spot-check` is
worth re-running if Wikidata's sequence data improves, and because the reasons
above should not have to be rediscovered.

THE SPOT CHECK GATES THIS GENERATOR.

P155/P156 on shared-universe films sometimes encodes *release* order rather
than *narrative necessity*, and those diverge — notably across the MCU, where
release order would name Black Panther as Infinity War's predecessor while the
film someone actually needs is Thor: Ragnarok. Chained at depth, release-order
edges manufacture a "required viewing" list that is really just a filmography.

`--spot-check` queries a fixed sample spanning tight sequels, a shared
universe, non-English franchises, and titles that should have no edge at all,
then prints what Wikidata claims for each so it can be judged by hand. Run it
before trusting this generator at scale. If contamination is common, pass
`--confidence 0.70` so every edge lands below the render floor and the offline
seed carries cross-franchise continuity instead.
