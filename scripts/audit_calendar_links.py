"""Audit every calendar_entries row already linked to TMDB, looking for a
silent mismatch — a row pointing at the wrong film or show.

Written after finding exactly this in production: a CSV row titled "King"
(Red Chillies Entertainment, releasing 2026-12-24) had been linked to
tmdb_id 1669639 — a 17-minute short also titled "King", releasing five
months off, on 2026-07-26. The root cause (backfill_calendar_tmdb.py never
sent `year` as an actual search parameter, and took the first exact-title
match rather than the best one) is fixed, but that fix only prevents new
mismatches — it does nothing for rows already linked before the fix existed.

Covers both ways a row gets a tmdb_id:

  - origin='csv_seed'      linked after the fact by backfill_calendar_tmdb.py,
                           via a title *search* — the step that could pick the
                           wrong same-titled result (the King bug).
  - origin='tmdb_upcoming' written directly by sync_calendar_tmdb.py from one
                           /discover result object — title, id, and date all
                           come from the same object, so there is no search
                           step to get ambiguous. A MISMATCH found here is a
                           more surprising, different-shaped bug (e.g. the
                           TMDB id was later merged into another record) than
                           a MISMATCH found in a csv_seed row, and is worth
                           reading closely rather than pattern-matching to
                           the King fix.

This runs in two stages either way, because a big date gap alone is not proof
of a wrong link:

  1. Compare each linked row's own release_date against what TMDB reports for
     the tmdb_id it was linked to. Anything beyond `--threshold-days` (default
     45, generous on purpose) becomes a *suspect* — same signature the King
     bug had, a ~5-month gap.

  2. Every suspect is re-run through the fixed matcher (same title, same
     calendar date) as a second opinion. A season-renewal row ("Undekhi
     Season 3") will always show a huge gap against its series' first
     air date — that is expected, not a bug — and the matcher confirms it by
     independently landing on the exact same id. Only a row where the matcher
     now disagrees is reported as a MISMATCH, which is the actual King-shaped
     signal: the old (unfixed) search picked one title, the fixed one picks
     another.

Read-only by default. Pass --apply to relink every MISMATCH row to the id the
fixed matcher picked — read the MISMATCH list first, since this is exactly
the kind of change worth eyeballing before it's automatic.
