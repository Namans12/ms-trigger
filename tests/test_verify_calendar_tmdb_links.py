"""title_matches: telling a wrong TMDB link apart from a season-suffixed one.

Found via this exact check: "Perfect Match" (our row) linked to a TMDB entry
also called "Perfect Match" whose overview is a Song Dynasty period drama —
title-string match, wrong film. Text similarity alone can't catch that (see
reconcile_calendar_duplicates.py's docstring for the general shape of this
problem); the caller does the overview-level judgment, this just decides
whether a title counts as "the same one" at the string level.
